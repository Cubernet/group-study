# Reading Group

 This Reading Group provides an opportunity for students, researchers and faculties to discuss and keep eyes on the current progress in `AI Security` and `Zero-trust-based Insider Threats`, and to learn how to do high-quality research.

## :page_facing_up: Discussion Format

The primary goal of the discussion is to *understand what the paper says*. With that in mind, the presenter should address the following points.
- Write down a note (a template can be found [here](./template/notes_tpl.md)), such that anyone who does not read the paper can have a high-level understanding (of main contents, advantages and disadvantages) based on your note. 
- Structure your presentation in slides, and guide the discussion through (i) what is the problem to be solved? (ii) what are the key ideas/insights/techniques used to address the problem? and (iii) How do the authors justify their design?

After discussion, keep the notes (in `md`) and slides (in `pdf`) in the directories `notes` and `slides`, respectively.
