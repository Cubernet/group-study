# Reading Group

 This Reading Group provides an opportunity for students, researchers and faculties to discuss and keep eyes on the current progress in `AI Security`, and to learn how to do high-quality research.

 ## Paper Selection

Consider to propose the *regular research papers* from the top conferences in the recent three years (the most recent are more preferred):

**Security Big 4**  

- CCS: ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
- S&P: IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
- Security: Usenix Security Symposium
- NDSS: ISOC Network and Distributed System Security Symposium

**Artificial Intelligence**  

- AAAI: AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence
    - [2020](https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai20contents.php), [2019](https://aaai.org/Library/AAAI/aaai19contents.php)
- NeurIPS: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems
- CVPR: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
- ICCV: International Conference on Computer Vision
- ICML: International Conference on Machine Learning
- IJCAI: International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence


## Discussion Format

The primary goal of the discussion is to *understand what the paper says*. With that in mind, the presenter should address the following points.

- Write down a note (a template can be found [here](./reading/template/notes_tpl.md)), such that anyone who does not read the paper can have a high-level understanding (of main contents, advantages and disadvantages) based on your note. 
- Structure your presentation in slides, and guide the discussion through (i) what is the problem to be solved? (ii) what are the key ideas/insights/techniques used to address the problem? and (iii) How do the authors justify their design?

After discussion, keep the notes (in `md`) and slides (in `pdf`) in the directories `notes` and `slides`, respectively.


## Schedule
