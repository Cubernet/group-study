> - How can the paper address the problem? Can you explain the *main idea* of the paper in your own words, while convincing readers that the idea exactly can solve the problem? At a high level, how does the paper convert the idea to a practical system/algorithm? 
> - How does the paper validate the systems/algorithms? More importantly, what are the *limitations* of the systems/algorithms? Are there any shadow corner in the systems/algorithms, yet not present in the paper?
