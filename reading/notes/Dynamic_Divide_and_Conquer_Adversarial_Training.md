**Summary**

This work explores methods to improve model robustness through adversarial training in the domain of semantic segmentation.

---

**Strengthens**  

- A training framework for semantic segmentation adversarial training based on pixel is proposed: Standard Adversarial Training(SAT)

- Improved on the SAT with the idea of pixel dividing: Dynamic Divide-and-Conquer Adversarial Training(DDC-AT)

---

**Weaknesses**  

- Lacking of comparison of time cost of training
- It can be explored through experiments that in the training process, the model tends to reduce the loss value by improving the accuracy of which model among fa, fm, and fn.
