**Summary**

The paper raised a machine learning method which add adversarial perturbations sparsely to part of the frames of a video.
To achieve this, the paper used the $L_{2,1}$ norm as one term of the optimization function, which constrain the number of perturbated frames.

**Strengthens**  

- Reduced the time cost
- Low Mean Absolute Perturbation(MAP)
- Provided an idea that use $L_{2,1}$ norm to achieve sparsity

**Weaknesses**  

- Specific architecture
- High perturbation rate for specific frames
