**Title:** Fast Is Better Than Free: Revisiting Adversarial Training

**Source:** ICLR 2020

**Authors:** Eric Wong,Leslie Rice,J. Zico Kolter

**Summary**

This work find a special adversarial training approach:FGSM adversarial training with random initialization, by using this approach to train model, the model can be as effective as the model trained by PGD adversarial training while having lower cost.

---

**Strengthens**  

- Speed up adversarial training without compromising the model robustness

- A variety of accelerated training methods are listed in this article for our reference

---

**Weaknesses**  

> Give a brief summarization of disadvantages (that can have been mentioned in the Summary part) in *bullets*. Do not trust papers in total, and use *critical thinking* (note that this is the *most important* skill in academic research; try to train this capability) to find shadow sides.

**Comments**  

> Give more detailed elaboration for each weakness point, and convince that *why it is a weakness*; if possible, try to give some fixing solution/suggestion. You can also pose some questions in this part.
