**Summary**

> The paper studied the soft-lable black-box attack method towards video recognition models, where only the predicted top-1 class and its probability are known to an attacker. Under this circumstance, former methods based on calculating the gradient directly fail to generate proper perturbations.To solve this problem, the paper extended the Opt-attack(Cheng et al. 2018) from image models to video models.By doing so, The problem turned into a optimization problem which can be solved by any zeroth order optimization algorithm.  

> On the other hand, the paper proposed heuristic temporal and spatial selection methods to achieve sparsity both in time and space.By sorting the probability of the subsets of the original videos, which is generated by clipping a frame from the original videos, the key frames can be found.  

> According to several experiments, the method has a better performance on time cost and sparsity than former methods.
